This page details all the equipment and tools I use on a daily basis.

For home, I use Ubuntu 19.04 in place of Windows now. Windows is still
a good platform for web development and if you are a Windows user you
can see how to use Windows Subsystem Linux for web development in
[this guide], I also made a video for setting up [Ubuntu for web
development].

## Home

### Editor + Terminal

- My computer is an ASUS Transformer Pro T304UA

- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code] with [Sarah Drasner]'s awesome [Night
  Owl] ðŸ¦‰ theme

- Terminal of choice is [Tilix].

- [Dank Mono] font for both text editor and terminal.

- I have now replaced my [AUKEY 104 Key LED-Backlit Mechanical
  Keyboard] with another [HAVIT KB395L], such a sweet keyboard!!

- I run two HP EliteDisplay's E232 58,4 cm (23") Monitors through a
  Dell 452-BBOO USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station.

- Microphone, a [Fifine Usb Cardioid Studio Condenser Microphone]
  which is surprisingly good quality for the price.

## Work

- My computer is an DELL XPS 15

- For development I use Windows Subsystem Linux in conjunction with
  Hyper terminal. ðŸ‘Œ [See here to set up your own].

- Keyboard, [HAVIT KB395L] (Kailh Low Profile Blue Switches)

- For gif capture I use LICEcap.

## Desktop Apps

- I use [Open Broadcaster Software](OBS) for recording some coding
  sessions.

- For light video editing I use [OpenShot Video Editor]
