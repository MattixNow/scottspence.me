Hi I'm Scott Spence üëã

### Backstory

A little bit about me, I have been a VBA developer since 2007 working
for companies such as Barclays and Deloitte. For the past ~18 months
now I have been learning web development (JavaScript) and all the
technologies and languages used therein.

I'm looking for a job, I'm sure that learning in a commercial
environment will accelerate my learning and knowledge as it did when I
started out as a VBA developer. Ideally, I'm looking for a role as a
junior-mid full-stack developer, but I'm equally open to front or back
as well.

I'm an analyst developer in the financial sector working in the City
of London, I'm married with a beautiful wife and daughter.

### Coding history

I learned to code [VBA] whilst working my first 'proper' job at
Barclays Bank as an assistant to the finance manager of a business
area, the scripting was to automate credit card reconciliation from
SAP and for producing monthly reporting figures, I was lucky enough to
have been spotted by one of the development managers on a different
team and offered a job as an Analyst Developer back in 2007, for the
past 11 years I have mainly worked with VBA in Excel, Access, Word and
in some cases PowerPoint!

The majority of solutions I made at Barclays were workflow tools, the
tracking of a cheque or payment through a process, lots of greenfeild
work with the focus on using the tools the business had to hand, so,
no SQL servers, just the MS Office suite, "user needs a database? Ok
cool lets set up an MS Access db on a file server somewhere" yes!

Sectors I have worked in: Finance [Risk, Asset Management], Property,
Oil & Gas and currently in the Lloyd's insurance market.

Tools of my trade: VBA, SQL some VB.NET and C#

### My interests

As I'm devoting nearly every spare hour I have to sitting in front of
a screen and studying, my main interests are currently:

* JavaScript learning all [teh] things!

* React - check the portfolio page for details

* Node - made several Twitter bots.

* GraphQL

Things on my 'I should learn that list':

* WebHooks

* GitHub integrations, I really want to build a badge-bot!

### Other interests

I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that took
up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused
on the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite,
[deadlift]!

Before that I used to play tennis three times a week up to a county
standard, I'd love to have the time to play tennis again but between
all the above there's not much time left. üôÉ

If there's anything you want to ask, you can [Ask Me Anything]

or

If you'd like to have a chat I'll be more than happy to have a [5
minute call] with you if you would like to know more about me.

All the best. üëç
