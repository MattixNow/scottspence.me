Hi there üëã thanks for taking an interest in me and my profile, I know
I'm nothing more than a keyword match right now, so I have gone to the
effort of putting this information here for you.

Please üôè, please, try to make it to the end. I know there's a fair
bit of info here and you have roles to fill. I'm trying to save us
both some time here. You're welcome üëç

## What's your current situation?

- I'm **not** actively looking for a new role.

## What's my ideal role?

- Junior to Mid level role to match my six months commercial
  experience.

- Working with React, Gatsby, Netlify and GitHub.

- Permanent, **not** open to contract roles right now (or for the next
  24 months or so).

  - From previous experience I feel I need to qualify this by saying a
    "contract of employment" i.e. a permanent role, not a "consultancy
    contract" between my business and the employer/client.

- Working in an agile environment using best practices for
  development.

- A good percentage of pair programming on the team.

- Working in a team where there is an emphasis on technical
  development.

- **If you really want to grab my attention,** tell me how you
  collaborate, how you keep quality high, how you contribute back to
  the community, and how you help your team continue to learn and
  grow.

- Work life balance is a big deal for me, I really **do not** want to
  go over a 42.5 hour working week.

## What's your preferred stack?

- Really enjoying using the [JAMStack] right now, with [Gatsby] (which
  uses **React** and **GraphQL**) being my framework of choice.

- For styling I have taken to using styled-components üíÖ, take a look
  at the used by section on their [site].

- For CMS I'd like the opportunity to work with [GraphCMS] or
  [Contentful].

- For back-end I prefer node which is where the majority of my
  back-end experience is.

## How many years experience do you have?

- Check out my [about] page which details my experience and a bit
  about me.

## Salary?

- Right now, for me, it's more about learning and progressing with the
  technology than it's about salary.

- If you don't want to give me a exact number then a range would be
  fine, but really the previous point covers it üòä.

## Are you willing to relocate?

- nop!

- For my development over the next 24 months or so I will get the most
  out of being office based closer to more experienced colleagues.

## What are your location preferences?

- I live a ~30 minute train ride from London Victoria/Blackfriars and
  prefer to avoid travelling by tube if possible.

  - I'll consider roles three or four tube stops **max** from either
    London Victoria or Blackfriars.

- Based in Swanley, Kent I'll consider places that are close to
  Sevenoaks and Bromley.

## Your skills look like a great match for this position we have. Can we have a quick five minute phone call to chat?

You are welcome to my phone number to call but I won't answer it
unless there is a prior arrangement or a recognise your number. I
prefer to avoid phone calls for these reasons:

- I'm on a [maker's schedule], which means interruptions are
  disruptive to my flow.

- I've already tried to answer some of the most basic questions on
  this site, and I've probably phrased them more clearly here than I
  will on the phone.

- This question gets asked frequently enough that my default answer
  has to be, if not **"no,"** at least **["read this first."]**

- Contact me by email. That's my preferred means of communication. If
  we are still interested in after some fact checking I'd love to have
  a chat.

- Want me to know you have spent more than the three seconds nearly
  all recruiters spend onm this page? (I use Google Analytics üëÄ)
  - In your email mention "Quick Start Guides Rock!" and you will have
    my attention and gratitude. üôè

## Can I take a look at your [CV]?

- Sure, my CV is here: [cv.scottspence.me].

- The CV use the [JSON Schema] standard, raw data [here].

## Do you have your CV in PDF/Word format?

- No.

- Please don't ask for the CV in MS Word/PDF format, the site is a
  reflection of my current skill level and intended for prospective
  employers to see, if your client want to see my CV give them the
  link.

- The link to my CV is my product and brand as it was built and styled
  by me. I consider this a way to showcase my current skill level.

## Notice period?

- Currently, [two weeks].

## Interview availability?

- I can telephone interview with little notice.

- It will entirely depend on the location for face to face interviews.
