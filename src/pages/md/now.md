## Work

Currently PM for a GitHub community project <code>grad.then()</code>
working with two other remote developers in Egypt and Serbia.
<code>grad.then()</code> is intended as a resource for post bootcamp
graduates to use as a resource for finding a full time role.

## Play

Back to the gym after Christmas break, I'm going to try focus more on
conditioning and cardio work for a while.
