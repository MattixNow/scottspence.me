#### Hi I'm Scott

### Backstory

A little bit about me, I have been a VBA developer since 2007 working
for companies such as Barclays and Deloitte. For the past ~24 months
now I have been learning web development (JavaScript) and all the
technologies and languages used therein.

I'm a front-end developer in the government digital transformation
space. I work in the City of London.

I'm [marriwed] to a beautiful wife and we have a beautiful daughter.

### Coding history

**Then:**

I learned to code [VBA] whilst working my first 'proper' job at
Barclays Bank as an assistant to the finance manager of a business
area, the scripting was to automate credit card reconciliation from
SAP and for producing monthly reporting figures, I was lucky enough to
have been spotted by one of the development managers on a different
team and offered a job as an Analyst Developer back in 2007, for the
past 11 years I have mainly worked with VBA in Excel, Access, Word and
in some cases PowerPoint!

The majority of solutions I made at Barclays were workflow tools, the
tracking of a cheque or payment through a process, lots of greenfeild
work with the focus on using the tools the business had to hand, so,
no SQL servers, just the MS Office suite, "user needs a database? Ok
cool lets set up an MS Access db on a file server somewhere" yes,
large corporations operate like this.

Sectors I have worked in: Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property,
Oil & Gas, Lloyd's insurance market and now government digital
transformation.

Tools of my trade: VBA, SQL some [VB.NET] and C#

**Now:**

I have (as of today) a 603 day GitHub streak, there are several OSS
projects I like to contribute to the majority of my commits are for my
projects, feel free to take a look 👀

I'm a massive fan of [Gatsby] and right now, enjoying integrating that
with as many things as possible, as of writing this I have four sites
that I'm using Gatsby with:

- [This site]
- [My blog]
- [My CV]
- [Gatsby using GraphCMS]

There is another contender to the static site gen throne that has
caught my eye and that is [React Static] currently I have a [branch]
I'm working on please check oit out! I'd love your feedback.

###### Gatsby all the things!!

Using Gatsby with CSS Grid and styled-components 💅 is an absolute joy
❤️

Tools of my trade: JavaScript, Gatsby, GraphQL, styled-components 💅
GraphCMS and Zeit [now] and [Netlify] for static site hosting 👌

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results]

### My interests

I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that took
up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused
on the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite,
[deadlift]!

Before that I used to play tennis three times a week up to a county
standard, I'd love to have the time to play tennis again but between
all the above there's not much time left. 🙃

If there's anything you want to ask, you can [Ask Me Anything]

All the best. 👍
