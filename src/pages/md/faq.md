Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for taking an interest in me and my profile, I know
I'm nothing more than a keyword match right now, so I have gone to the
effort of putting this information here for you.

### What's my ideal role?

* Working in an agile environment using best practices for
  development.

* A good percentage of pair programming on the team.

* Working in a team where there is an emphasis on technical
  development.

* **If you really want to grab my attention,** tell me how you
  collaborate, how you keep quality high, how you contribute back to
  the community, and how you help your team continue to learn and
  grow.

* Work life balance is a big deal for me, I really **do not** want to
  go over a 42.5 hour working week.

### What's your preferred stack?

* Really enjoying using the [JAMStack] right now, [Gatsby] (which uses
  **React** and **GraphQL**).

* For styling I have taken to using styled-components ðŸ’…, take a look
  at the used by section on their [site].

* For CMS I'd like the opportunity to work with [GraphCMS] or
  [Contentful].

* For back-end I prefer node which is where the majority of my
  back-end experience is.

### Salary?

* Right now, for me, it's more about learning and progressing with the
  technology than it's about salary.

* If you don't want to give me a exact number then a range would be
  fine, but really the previous point covers it ðŸ˜Š.

### Are you willing to relocate?

* nop!

* I'll consider fully remote with minimal travel, two weeks at most
  per year.

### What are your location preferences?

* I live a ~30 minute train ride from London Victoria/Blackfriars and
  prefer to avoid travelling by tube if possible.

* Based in Swanley, Kent I'll consider places very close to Sevenoaks
  and Bromley.

### Your skills look like a great match for this position we have. Can we setup a phone call to chat?

I prefer to avoid phone calls for a number of reasons:

* I'm on a [maker's schedule], which means interruptions are
  disruptive to my flow.

* I've already tried to answer some of the most basic questions on
  this site, and I've probably phrased them more clearly here than I
  will on the phone.

* This question gets asked frequently enough that my default answer
  has to be, if not **"no,"** at least **["read this first."]**

* Contact me by email. That's my preferred means of communication. If
  we are still interested in things after a few email exchanges,
  perhaps then a phone call can be arranged.

### Can I take a look at your [CV]?

* Sure, my CV uses the [JSON Schema] so you can find that [here].

* Prefer something better formatted then take a look at [this].

### My last two roles overlap, yes.

* I'm still showing as at OES Technology because I own the company.

### Notice period?

* Currently, two weeks.

### Interview availability?

* I can telephone interview with little notice.

* It will entirely depend on the location for face to face interviews.
