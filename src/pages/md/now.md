## Work

Working as a Web Developer for [Karmarama], using a variety of
technologies. I'm currently working on a project that uses NextJS for
the front-end with Apollo and Prisma with GraphQL Yoga for the
back-end.

## Play

Code! I've been coding a lot, wouldn't really say it's play, but it
has been taking up a lot of my spare time recently.

Back at the gym, currently five days a week ðŸ˜¬ and alternating heavy
ant light days with barbell training: Squat, Bench, Press, Deadlift
and rows.

Diet I have started the 16/8 fasting again and a 24hr fast midweek.

I have been to Spain 4 times this year and to Malta (Gozo) for a long
weekend to attend a friends wedding.
