    <p>Hi I&#39;m Scott,</p>

    <p>
      A little bit about me, I have been a VBA developer since 2007
      working for companies such as Barclays and Deloitte. For the
      past ~18 months now I have been learning web development
      (JavaScript) and all the technologies and languages used
      therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m looking for a job, I&#39;m sure that learning in a
      commercial environment will accelerate my learning and knowledge
      as it did when I started out as a VBA developer. Ideally,
      I&#39;m looking for a role as a junior-mid full-stack developer,
      but I&#39;m equally open to front or back as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you&#39;d like to have a chat I&#39;ll be more than happy to
      have a{' '}
